### What is this repository for? ###
This repository serves as a technical test for developers pursuing a position at HiQ Sk√•ne.

## Instructions ##
Thank you for taking the time to do HiQ's recruitment test. It consists of two parts:
* Coding test
* A few questions

### Coding test ###
* In this repository you'll find two different tests:
	* One for developers focusing on backend technoligies only
	* One for developers focusing on frontend technologies, or both frontend and backend technologies.
	* Choose the one best matching your preferences.
* You are free to choose what specific technologies to use in this assignment, however we'd like you to provide a motivation on your choices.
* Automated tests are nice, but not mandatory

### Questions ###
Please answer these questions in a markdown file called `Answers.md`.

1. How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?
2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.
3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
4. What did you think of this recruitment test?

## How do I hand in my solution? ##
* Please send your solution to [kajsa.norell@hiq.se](mailto:kajsa.norell@hiq.se) as a zip-file 
    * All typically ignored files and folders should be removed (node_modules, bin etc).
    * The zip-file should contain a clone of this git repo, with your work added in commit(s).
    * Try to make the solution as easy as possible for us to get up and running to test drive.

### If we agree to meet for an interview ###
* Please bring your application along to your interview
    * Be prepared to run and demonstrate the application. 
    * Be prepared to present the code in an IDE of your choice on your own computer. 
* In addition to this assignment you should also be prepared to show other projects you developed (if you have any).



### If I have any questions ###
