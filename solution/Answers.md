## 1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?
 - 2-3 hours

## 2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution and any other specific choices you made.
 - Im currently using Ionic Framework/Angular in a different project, think it is fun and easy to use thats why i choosed it.
 - Regarding the code structure in the backend project i always try to create different projects in the solution and carefully   think how the reference between them should work, but this is the minimal way i try to setup.
 - When i create methods i try to follow the SRP principle, let the method only do one thing and name it correctly, this is much easier for other developers to understand and it also make unit testing more flexible. 

## 3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time  on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
- Write more Unittest
- Add som logging with NLog or some other framework. 
- Spend more time on styling

## 4. What did you think of this recruitment test?
